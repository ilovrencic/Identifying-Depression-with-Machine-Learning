<TEXT> I feel the same. I've got a decent life but I still don't like it, I find anything wrong with it and over think it until I can find a reason to not like it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm really looking forward to starting treatment and I'm happy that I've taken that leap to get treatment, we will see how it goes. I haven't got an addictive personality I don't believe anyway. I don't smoke, I very rarely drink even since finding out I've got depression.

I should really try and go to the gym but its having to get that motivation and when you've got your head telling you 'whats the point?' its hard to ignore it.

I find it hard to make friends, I'm not the popular one. I'm the girl who sat inside gaming all evening while my friends were out because I didn't enjoy going out, since then all my friends have abandoned me since I broke up with my ex-bf. The one friend I have barely speaks to me. Any other friends I have rarely speak to me. It's a vicious cycle of... no friends and it kills me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live in the UK. I'm in a good situation, got a good job, got an amazing SO... sometimes I look at my life and keep thinking.. how can I be depressed? But then I remember I have no friends which is my main issue.

Thanks for your advise. </TEXT>
