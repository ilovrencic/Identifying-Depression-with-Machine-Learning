<TEXT> Sorry, I didn't explain the 2am thing well, I would only ask to talk if he's staying at mine or vice versa. I wouldn't just ring him whenever I felt down. Only when he's physically next to me I would ask.

I think it's reasonable to expect your other half to spend New year's eve with you, especially as it doesn't mean losing out on time with your friends. I wasn't too cut up about Halloween, i just thought it was a but selfish to stay at mine afterwards when he could have stayed at his friends house (which is in the same area and would have had free beds). It was more that I felt a little used rather than being annoyed. The tone of voice for his response was the kind that a teenager would use when their mum says they can't go to the party unless they tidy they're room (not sure the exact word). I didn't cut him off though, it's a response I have that instead of arguing when I'm not really sure if I want to start an argument. I think he was convinced that I had work to do (because I do at the minute), not that I was angry.

I usually remove myself from a situation if I think I'm going to have an over dramatic/emotional response. It gives me time to think about the situation and respond rationally. I do go back to the issue rather than bury it in the sand.

I don't even know who's to blame with the lack of conversation; a fault on both our parts. But when you're 19/21, I think a lack of conversation isn't a good sign, we don't have the strains of work/kids that married couples potentially have. I'd say the lack of conversation is mainly my fault because sometimes I don't want to talk and this may be hard to discern or he may feel like certain topics may set me off. They don't really, but it could be his was of trying to protect me or something.

I feel like I should make time to work on myself instead of being in a relationship; as you said, it is hard to motivate yourself to improve anything, let alone a relationship. However, I don't want to lose out on something potentially great because of my illness. I think your comment about not being into anything could be spot on. But it might not be. It's hard to differentiate between what's being caused by depression and if I would feel this way if I didn't have depression.

I'm not sure if he takes the illness seriously, because I don't 'act depressed' all the time. By this I mean it's not the typical depression that the media portrays (which hardly anyone with depression irl acts like). Or it could be he doesn't know how to react. I've pointed him towards depression forums and talked to him but I don't know.

I am currently in treatment; not sure if it's working so I'm going back to the doctors to seek a second opinion or a different treatment.

Thanks for your response, I really appreciate it. I'm going to take on board all of your points and think about this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How do you know when a relationship is over or when you're going through a rough patch?

Recently me and my boyfriend have been having a rough time. Well, rather I've been having a rough time, from what I can gather he doesn't seem to be having the same thoughts as me regarding our relationship.

I suffer from depression (this is a throwaway account I use for that, see my other post if you want some details about it). I realise that I can be difficult to be around at times. Mood swings, teary, not wanting to talk to/speak to anyone. But when I do want to talk to someone he just isn't there for me. I understand that 2am may not be the best time to talk, but I can't really time when I do and don't reach out to someone. He's the only person who I talk to about being depressed. I've told another friend but since then she just acts like the conversation never happened (which is understandable if you don't know how to deal with/approach the situation). However, I know I wouldn't be able to sleep if he was having a crisis moment. Am I being unfair?

I feels like he cares more about his friends than me; though again I don't know if I'm being unfair/clingy. I spent last Halloween with his friends (some of who I would consider my friends in the sense that I'd keep contact if we ever broke up). This year he was supposed to spend Halloween with me and my friends (who he gets along with - so thats not the issue); instead he went out with his own friends but still used my place to crash. Not so upset about this because it's Halloween (hardly a couples night) and I had a great night with my friends. 

I spent New year's eve with his friends so sort of expected him to spend this New year's with me and my friends (I was going a house party which his friends could also come to). His friends have half planned to go out to a local bar for New year's, but even when I told him about the house party he was still deliberating going out with his friends. It may sound petty, but I was quite hurt and when I told him this he was like 'fine, I'll spend New year's with you'.  I didn't really feel like talking much after this so I ended the conversation telling him I had uni work to do. I've always viewed New year's as if you have a partner, spend it with them; is my reaction uncalled for?

I also feel like we haven't had much to talk about lately; I can still have regular conversations with my friends but our conversations seem strained or non existent. We still have a normal sex life, but I'm beginning to wonder if it the physical contact and having someone there I'll miss or our relationship. 

I've never cheated and I would never do something like that in a relationship. I'm beginning to get a little jealous of my house mates who can go out and kiss/ bring back whoever they like, but not so much that I'd consider cheating. Question to older people: At 19 did you really know who you wanted to spend the rest of your life with? Or am I just getting a case of 'the grass is always greener on the other side'?

As far as Christmas goes, we have a spend limit, but I've only got one thing because I was planning on a trip away so would only be giving him a few things to open on Christmas day. I'm not sure whether I should book the trip or not.

I'm still unsure about the relationship so wouldn't break up just yet. I don't think I'd break up with someone right before Christmas either though. Any different opinions/viewpoints on that out of curiosity?

There are a few more issues, and obviously there are good points to the relationship too, but I'm exhausted and don't feel like typing more.
---

tl;dr Not sure whether to continue my 2 year relationship with bf because of several issues. Also not sure if I am blowing issues out of proportion. I also suffer from depression which could be another thing that is fucking with my viewpoint/the relationship. Help greatly appreciated (sorry this tldr is quite long) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would definitely agree with the baby steps thing. Although first go see an doctor (and maybe ask a friend or a family member to go with you and go to future appointments with you for support).
Every day make a list of ten things you're going to do (or any number but I find consistency has helped me. Here's just an example :
1. Get up at 9
2. Get a shower
3. Eat something for breakfast
4. Get a template for a cv
5. Spend five minutes doing stretches
6. Drink 3 glasses of water
7. Read something (an article or a chapter of a book...whatever)
8. Spend 10 minutes tidying
9. Get 9 hours of sleep

Obviously at the start you might not even be able to do these things. You might want to start with a list of two or three things then gradually increase it. Your first step is seeing a doctor though. There are a few hotlines you can call if you can't see the doctor straight away (I'm unsure what country you are from but hopefully google might help with finding these hotlines).

To help with the tiredness I'd suggest 9 hours of sleep every night, eating healthily and exercise but these things aren't going to help if you're ill. Look up sleep patterns and things like that (I don't know why but at least trying to sort out my problems, even if I can't fully fix them gives me a little comfort). I found the articles interesting and at least I was doing something more productive than wallow in my bed.

What calms you down/ makes you sleepy? Try teas for night time or malty drinks before you go to bed. If you can fathom it exercise will make you tired. Listen to your favourite calming music (personally I like Sigur Ros). Read a book. Doodle.

Your list mights start with something like having a shower, shaving (unsure of gender, so just a suggestion), putting on some deodorant and putting on a clean outfit. It may sound silly but it will make you feel better.

I wish I could take all the advice I've given you and apply it to myself but it's nearly 4am and I'm still wide awake. Whatever happens you aren't a failure and there are (unfortunately) a lot of people who can relate to what you are going through. I can't promise things will get better straight away, or even soon, but nothing will change if you don't take the first step in seeing a professional. You've already made a huge step just by reaching out with your post. I hope this helps even slightly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do try to draw, but I can't seem to motivate myself to finish anything and it makes me feel worse then. I hate looking through sketchbooks and seeing unfinished drawings or paintings. I can't remember the last time I finished any art. And then I wonder why I get so worked up about something so trivial, kinds funny in a sad way. I can totally relate to you when I think about my problems though, I have no financial issues, I'm at a really good uni studying a good course (which actually has job prospects at the end), I have friends and a good relationship and I'm not living in a slum in a 3rd world country. I've read a lot of times depression being described as the illness of our generation </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks, I've read that comic before but would recommend it to anyone (whether you feel like you have depression or not) because it describes mental illness so well. I care sometimes, it's mainly when I'm alone that I feel worst. I also feel really shit if I've spent too much time with people and haven't had any alone time (way to go brain...smart).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a good way of looking at it but in my head I'm the person running in an screaming about the scratch on my arm while someone else is sitting there with two broken arms. I know it's silly and I know you're right, there is always going to be someone with 'bigger' problems, it doesn't change your own situation. Thanks for the advice </TEXT>

<TEXT> It wasn't as though he formally said 'you have depression' which is why I'm left so confused. He said 'it's normal to feel depressed and it's not your fault' etc, and prescribed anti-depressants, but I don't know. I should probably ask the doctor for more detail, to discuss the problem and course of action at my next appointment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I only went to see someone after feeling like this for ages and being urged by my boyfriend. Even as I told the doctor I was worried he would look at me like I was making it up. I was so paranoid that the pharmacist would think 'well they don't look depressed'. None of them were judgemental forever. I have two close friends with depression, one who has it quite bad to the point where she won't leave bed and will drink a lot to feel something. The other just seems so lost, I feel so bad for him, he's the smartest guy I know but he just feels helpless after dropping out of a uni degree his parents forced him into. It's hard to even compare myself to them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't really know. I like making people laugh or drawing but I haven't drawn anything properly in a while. Thanks for the help, I feel like I'm a burden when I talk to other people because I don't have things that are tangible to worry about like money, relationship problems etc. The worst thing is that it's hard to explain. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks, this description helps a lot. I have another appointment in a week to get blood tests done and another in 3 weeks time to increase my medication dose. I think one of the main things was that the doctor was so quick to prescribe medication. I don't know, I guess I would have liked to have talked more but I couldn't really bring myself to talk much. Hopefully the next few appointments will bring me some clarity. </TEXT>
