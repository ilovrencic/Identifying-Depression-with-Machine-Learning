<TEXT> I didn't film it for Youtube. I didn't even know there was a spider problem in Chicago. I filmed it for my Husband and friends who were at the Grateful Dead Concert while I was in the hotel room. I didn't know it was going to go on for 4 days and thought they may be gone by the time they came back. It wasn't until yesterday that Huffington Post asked for footage. Not everyone films every event in their lives. It is what it is and I held the camera the way I did. I didn't plan out a video shoot. I turned on the camera and caught the spiders flying at the window. It also happened weeks before the issue broke in the news. I didn't upload it until yesterday.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't film it for you. I filmed it to show my friends and Husband. I didn't think which way I was holding the camera. The camera was an after thought. I was then asked for the video from Huffington Post because they didn't have footage as it was happening. I have used the video on my camera around 5 times so please don't judge me personally because you don't like the way I was holding it.

<TEXT> Facebook started doing it too. There were ads in the middle of the newsfeed. Once they blocked the button to get out off of it and I had to turn off the computer to get out. Yeah for adblock. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The best thing I can say is my father is a strict Republican. When ever I don't feel like talking I just say one thing against the Republican Party and put the phone down. Twenty minutes later I pick it up and say.. yep and then put it down for another twenty minutes. I love him but will just never agree on politics with him.
